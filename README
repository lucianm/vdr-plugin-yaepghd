Description:

Yaepghd is a complete rewrite of the original yaepg plugin.  The
original yaepg plugin was designed for FF cards and only used 4
colors due to limitations on the amount of OSD memory on FF cards.
Yaepghd requires output devices with an OSD capable of high color
full screen graphics (e.g. eHD or xine) and will _not_ work with FF
cards (unless you have the 4MB mod).

In the original yaepg the layout and sizes of all the components
were hardcoded in the source code which made it difficult to
customize.  Yaepghd uses themes which allow a user to completely
redfine the the way yaepghd looks.

Themes must be placed in the $(CONFDIR)/plugins/yaepghd directory.
Any fonts used by a theme must be added to the fontconfig cache.
This can be done by either copying the fonts to one of your existing
font directories or by adding the yaepghd theme directory to your
font path.  After this is done you must run fc-cache for the new
font to be available.

Installation:

cd /put/your/path/here/VDR/PLUGINS/src
tar -xzf /put/your/path/here/vdr-yaepghd-X.Y.Z.tgz
ln -s yaepghd-X.Y.Z yaepghd
cd /put/your/path/here/VDR
patch -p1 < PLUGINS/src/yaepghd/patches/vdr-X.Y.Z-yaepghd.patch # Optional

cp PLUGINS/src/yaepghd/patches/make.global ./  # only for vdr < 1.7.13

cp -R PLUGINS/src/yaepghd/yaepghd /path/to/vdrconf/plugins/
make
make plugins
./vdr -P yaepghd 

Options:

  -i path, --epgimages=path
      Path to the epgimages (Default: /video/epgimages).

Notes:
- This README has to be updated !

- Yaepghd patch is no longer supported, as now the ScaleVideo API introduced with
  vdr-1.7.33 is used.

- Video window doesn't scale back to normal when quiting the plugin
  with FF cards.

- Yaepghd may need a few seconds to set a switch timer, as it has to wait for
  the EPGSearch plugin.

- The colors of the epg images may be distorted if AntiAliasing is enabled in vdr osd setup.
